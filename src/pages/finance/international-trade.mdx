After the discovery of oil in 1850, International Trade increased exponentially.

**In 1950: US$289 billion**

**In 2019: US$20 trillion**

## Advantages

International Trade offers a range of opportunities:

- Raising income (valorizing work)
- Creating jobs (workforce is needed)
- Reducing price
- Workers' earning power

## Interconnection

The global economy is interconnected with international trade:

- When trade decreases -> jobs & businesses are lost
- Globalization is a benefit of international trade
- International trade can also have devastating effects

## Disadvantages

International Trade can cause economic & social disruption

## Why export ?

- Production surplus (having more produced goods than needed)
- Sell domestic products to countries at a higher price than the local price
- Earn foreign currency (<span className="highlight">USD</span>)

## Why import ?

- Faster, cheaper, better qualit, mutual gains, opportunity cost
- To buy essential goods and services or attractive products that are not available domestically
- Goods that satisfy domestic needs
- Products that are cheaper than producing domestically
- More efficient to import rather than producing domestically

## Steps

- (1) Identify buyers (potential market)
- (2) Find low skill labour country
- (3) Find country with abundance of Capital (tend to specialize)
- (4) Efficiency and reduce competitions

## Rules

- No country specializes in the export of a single product
- All countries produce at least some goods and services
- Lower income countries might produce more efficiently

## Trade Balance

- Difference between imports and exports
- <span className="highlight red">**IMPORT**</span> > <span className="highlight green">**EXPORT**</span> = **TRADE DEFICIT**
- <span className="highlight red">**IMPORT**</span> < <span className="highlight green">**EXPORT**</span> = **TRADE SURPLUS**

**Trade deficit** =

- sign of economic weakness
- less domestic production & jobs
- risk of economic crisis

## Manipulating International Trade

- wide array of economic, political, diplomatic objectives
- globalization (global trade flows, economic growth and prosperity)
- Trade Agreements: EU/NAFTA
- Governments regulate/deregulate trade

### How ?

- restricting imports
- encouraging exports
  - <span className="highlight">Tarrifs</span>: **import taxes** => government revenues
  - <span className="highlight">Quotas</span>: quantitative restrictions
- protecting health or satefy (COVID-19)
- economic sanctions
- export subsidies: supporting export producers

### Consequences of trade restrictions

- Costs: raising price of imported goods
  - tax on domestic consumers
  - quotas, tariffs, subsidies
- Discourage to import
- Less incentive to improve
- Impediments to development efforts
