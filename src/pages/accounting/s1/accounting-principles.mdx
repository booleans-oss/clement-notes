## Principle of non-accumulation

<Callout type="info">
  Assets and liabilities must be valued separately. No offsetting can be made
  between items (balance sheet and income statement lines) of assets and
  liabilities in the balance sheet or between items of expenses and income in
  the income statement.
</Callout>

Assets and Liabilities' values do not affect each other.

## Principle of consistency of methods

<Callout type="info">
  Unless an exceptional change occurs in the situation of the trader, natural or
  legal person, the presentation of the annual accounts as well as the valuation
  methods used cannot be modified from one financial year to another. If changes
  occur, they are described and justified in the notes.
</Callout>

The choice of valuation methods and final statements should always be the same, unless exceptional change.

## Principle of prudence

<Callout type="info">
  The accounts are drawn up on the basis of prudent assessments, in order to
  avoid the risk of transferring, to future periods, present uncertainties
  likely to affect the company's assets and results.
</Callout>

Risk should be shown in accounts.

## Going concern principle

<Callout type="info">
  For the preparation of the annual accounts, the trader, whether a natural or
  legal person, is presumed to continue its activities.
</Callout>

The person does not stop doing financial accounts even with exceptions.

## Principle of independence of accounting periods

<Callout type="info">
  The various users of accounting information (owners, managers, personnel,
  third parties and the State) need periodic information. It is necessary to
  determine the results of the past management of the company and to foresee the
  future results, and thus to divide the continuous life of the companies into
  periods or accounting periods. In addition, expenses and income belong to a
  specific year.
</Callout>

Accounts should be time-period specific and independant and income statements belong to a specific year.

## Principle of intangibility of the opening balance sheet

<Callout type="info">
  The opening balance sheet of a fiscal year must correspond to the closing
  balance sheet of the previous fiscal year.
</Callout>

Opening balance should be the same as closing balance of the previous year.

## Historical cost principle

<Callout type="info">
  Accounting uses the monetary unit without taking into account changes in its
  purchasing power. It therefore assumes that the monetary unit is a stable unit
  of measurement and that monetary units from different periods can be added
  together (no discounting).
</Callout>

Currencies are stable and do not change in value.

## Materiality principle

<Callout type="info">
  The regularity and sincerity of the accounts are assessed in relation to the
  translation of the knowledge that the directors have of the reality and the
  relative importance of the events recorded.
</Callout>

Honesty.

## Principle of good information

<Callout type="info">
  Beyond compliance with the rules and principles, the essential problem is to
  provide the various users of financial documents with satisfactory
  information, i.e. sufficient and meaningful information to understand them.
</Callout>

Information should be sufficient and meaningful (necessary).

## Principle of substance over form

<Callout type="info">
  Accounting translates information by emphasizing the economic reality of the
  transaction, rather than the form or terms of the transaction. In the case of
  certain transactions, there are difficulties in resolving accounting problems
  of application, some wanting to translate the legal operation, others the
  financial reality.
</Callout>

Information should be the reality.
