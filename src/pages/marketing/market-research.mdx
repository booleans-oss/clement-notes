- collecting and analyzing non-numerical data (e.g., text, video, or
  audio)

#### How does it work ?

- Conducted by a specialist
- Small sample
- Selection mode of participants
- Analysis

#### What for ?

- Exploratory basis study
- Sensitive matter
- Knowledge enhancement
- Screening/alternative reduction
- New idea generation

#### Types

- <u>Focus group</u>: small group, open debate, one moderator, interaction between participants, timing, non-judgemental.
- <u>Depth interview</u>: 2 people, directive to semi-structure to non-directive, 1h30 to 2h, in home or in facility, recorded, 30 people max, online bulletin.
