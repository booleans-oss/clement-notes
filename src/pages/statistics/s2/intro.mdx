## What is statistics ?

<Callout type="info">
  Set of scientific methods aimed at{" "}
  <span className="highlight">collecting</span>,{" "}
  <span className="highlight blue">organizing</span>,{" "}
  <span className="highlight red">presenting</span>,{" "}
  <span className="highlight pink">modelling</span> data and{" "}
  <span className="highlight green">constructing</span> numerical summaries.
</Callout>

Statistics: <br/>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Numerical data</span> (e.g. <i>consumption of French households</i>)<br/>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Non-numerical data</span> (e.g. <i>marital situation</i>)

## Measures of central tendency

<Callout type="info">
  **Central tendency** describes the tendency of the observations{" "}
  <span className="highlight">to bunch around</span> a particular value or
  category
</Callout>

Three ways: <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Mean</span> (average) <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Median</span> (middle value) <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Mode</span> (most frequent value)

### Mean

**MEAN = AVERAGE**

<Callout type="info">
  Add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are
</Callout>
<br />

Formula: <Latex>$\bar\{x\} = \frac\{\sum_\{i=1\}^\{n\} x_i\}\{n\}$</Latex>

### Median

**MEDIAN = MIDDLE VALUE**

<Callout type="info">
  Put the numbers in ascending order and find the middle value. If there are two
  middle values, take the average of the two.
</Callout>

Formula:

<Latex>$Median = \begin\{cases\}x_\{\frac\{n+1\}\{2\}\} & \text\{if n is odd\} \\\\\\\\ \frac\{x_\{\frac\{n\}\{2\}\} + x_\{\frac\{n\}\{2\} + 1\}\}\{2\} & \text\{if n is even\}\end\{cases\}$</Latex>

### Mode

**MODE = MOST FREQUENT VALUE**

<Callout type="info">Most commonly occuring number.</Callout>

## Measures of dispersion

<Callout type="info">
  **Dispersion** describes the spread of the observations around the central
  tendency
</Callout>

Three ways: <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Range</span> (difference between the
largest and smallest values) <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Variance</span> (average of the squared
deviations from the mean) <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- <span class="highlight">Standard deviation</span> (square root
of the variance)

### Range

**RANGE = DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LARGEST AND SMALLEST VALUES**

<Callout type="info">
  Shows distributions of dataset with lowest and highest limits.
</Callout>

Formula: <Latex>$Range = x_\{max\} - x_\{min\}$</Latex>

### Variance

**VARIANCE = AVERAGE OF THE SQUARED DEVIATIONS FROM THE MEAN**

<Callout type="info">
  Shows how far the numbers are spread out from their average value.
</Callout>

Formula: <Latex>$\sigma^2 = \frac\{\sum_\{i=1\}^\{n\} (x_i - \bar\{x\})^2\}\{n\}$</Latex>

### Standard deviation

**STANDARD DEVIATION = SQUARE ROOT OF THE VARIANCE**

<Callout type="info">Shows how much variation there is from the mean.</Callout>

Formula: <Latex>$\sigma = \sqrt\{\sigma^2\} = \sqrt\{\frac\{\sum_\{i=1\}^\{n\} (x_i - \bar\{x\})^2\}\{n\}\}$</Latex>

## What is Market Research ?

<Callout type="info">
  **Systematic** and **objective** <span className="highlight">identification</span>
  , <span className="highlight red">collection</span>,{" "}
  <span className="highlight blue">analysis</span> and
  <span className="highlight violet">interpretation</span> of data to develop marketing strategy
  or solve a market problem.

  </Callout>

- Allows company to discover target market
- Links consumer with marketer (marketing decisions)
- Get feedback/opinion from customers
- In-house or by third-party companies

### Uses

- Identify market opportunities and problems
- Evaluate potential market actions
- Monitor marketing performance
- Help understand customer behaviour

## Tools

- **Surveys** (questionnaires, interviews)
- **Product testing**
- **Focus groups** (observations, experiments)

## Types of Research

### Basic Research

<Callout type="info">
  - Verify an existing theory or learn more about a concept or phenomenon - Not
  aimed at solving a particular pragmatic problem
</Callout>

### Applied Research

<Callout type="info">
  - Conducted when a decision must be made about a specific real-life problem -
  Studies are designed to solve practical problems of the modern world
</Callout>

## Marketing Research Process

<Steps>
 ### Step 1: Identify and define the problem

- Starts with problem discovery
- Find something that has gone wrong
- Gap between what actual and ideal situation (what should have happened and what actually happened)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  - Low grades of students in mathematics - Decrease in company's sales -
  Preference of mode of transport - High rate of employee turnover - Low wages
  of workers
</Callout>

### Step 2: Set objectives

- What do you want to achieve?
- What do you want to learn?
- What do you want to know?

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  - Figuring out the impact of studying hours on grades - Finding the impact of
  discounts on sales volume - Role of gender in choosing career paths
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Research Method

- **Exploratory**
- **Descriptive**
- **Casual research**

"The <span class="highlight">objectives</span> of the study, the <span class="highlight red">available data</span> sources, the <span class="highlight orange">urgency</span> of the decision and the <span class="highlight blue">cost</span> of obtaining the data will determine which method should be chosen."

### Surveys

- Most common method of <span class="highlight pink">descriptive research</span>
- data from sample using a questionnaire
- writing questions, selecting sample, collecting data, analyzing data

## Population vs Sample

<Callout type="info">
  **Population** = entire group.
  <br />
  **Sample** = subset of population. **Sampling** = process of selecting a
  subset of population.
</Callout>

  alt="Population vs Sample"
/>
<img
  className="light"
  src="/statistics/intro/population-sample-light.png"
  alt="Population vs Sample"
/>

For a good sampling we need:

- who is to be sampled ?
- how large a sample is needed ?
- how sampling units will be selected ?

<Callout type="info">
  A good sample should have the same characteristics as the population.
</Callout>
